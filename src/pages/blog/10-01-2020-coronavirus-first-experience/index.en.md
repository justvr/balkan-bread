It all started somewhere far away.

And it still seemed kind of far away when I was on vacation with a friend in France, close to the Italian border.

We met a couple of tourists who had fled Italy because of the quarantine that had just begun. They talked about their experiences and how difficult it was to find transportation even to the airport. I listened and thought: etymologically, quarantine was caused by the plague. It rolls over in my stomach and I decide. Surely it’s not possible.

I was on vacation mode. It all still seemed a long way away.

At least it did until We reached our accommodation.

When our hosts opened the door they were wearing masks and asked us to remove our shoes. They packed our shoes into a bag and asked us not to wear them inside due to the coronavirus.

Somehow the worries melt away as we walk through a square full of people and enjoy a beautiful sunset from the fortress

But on the way back, just half an hour later, we find an empty square. Closed restaurants.

France has entered quarantine. We walk through empty streets. In a city of millions there’s no one to be seen.

Naturally we decide that this marks the end of our trip. We pay extra and change our flights to arrive home early.

The borders between the nations of the European Union are to be closed from Monday.

On the way to the airport, passers-by, returning from the market, notice that I lack funds for disinfection. They give me new anti-bacterial wipes. They ask about the situation in Germany. Everyone is overwhelmed by current events in their own countries, and it is no longer possible to follow the situations elsewhere.

I’ve never seen so many people at the airport. They cancel one flight to Spain. Passengers complain that they’ve been at the airport since the morning and it is already late afternoon. They need to remain there until further notice. Spain has closed its borders.

In the meantime, <a href="https://www.srbija.gov.rs/vest/en/151410/serbia-closes-borders-due-to-coronavirus.php" rel="noopener noreferer"> Serbia closes borders without any announcement</a>.

I'm going back to Berlin, where everything still looks like that time without the crown.Masks are not being worn on public transport nor on the street. The virus is still far far away.

I'm not on vacation anymore. I'm afraid of the virus. I fear for my future as a worker in Germany with a visa.

A few days later, on March 22, 2020, the first quarantine due to coronavirus begins in Germany.
