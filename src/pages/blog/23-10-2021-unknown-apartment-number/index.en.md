I recently moved to Berlin.

My friends invited me to stop by. They gave me the address. I arrive in front of the apartment and I don't understand. Where is the apartment number.

Only last name at address. There seems to be no chance of the unpaid bills being transferred to the new tenant.

<a href="https://www.balkanbread.com/en/ulice-sa-duplim-imenom" rel="noreferer noopener">Besides double streets</a>, there are no apartment numbers? Well it seems so.

To find someone I really need to check the address well.
Damn, I got lost.
