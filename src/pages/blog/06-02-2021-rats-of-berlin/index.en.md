------
I recently moved to Berlin.

Less than a month went by and my parents, like all Serbian parents, flew over to see where I lived.

One morning, as my father calmly sipped his first coffee and enjoyed the view of the park, a rat crossed one of the paths.

He asked me: What is that?

I feigned ignorance and said I didn't see anything. Then a second later another rat scampered across.

My father asked: Is that a rat?! I answered uncertainly: I don't think so.

But my efforts weren’t worth it. By the time he had finished his coffee, a dozen rats had come out for a stroll.

He exclaimed: There’s a lot of rats here!

No cats, no dogs, only rats!

But there really are a lot of them everywhere. You see them by the lake, in trash cans, at the park, at metro stations, on the pavements,…

I met a couple of people who had them as pets. They received them as a romantic gift from a partner or they bought them themselves.

Those who have owned them say they are very smart and easy to train. Another person says that after just a couple of weeks he went from 2 mice in the house to 41.

Maybe it's not so odd that there are so many of them in the city ...
