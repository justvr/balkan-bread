------
I recently moved to Berlin.

Walking down the street one can easily notice boxes with a note - Zu verschenken (ger. To give away).

Passers-by often stand next to the box to see what is hidden in there.

You can usually find children's things - toys, car seats, clothes, baby equipment. Then books and furniture. From furniture, mostly shelves, refrigerators, mattresses, chairs, things that are easily portable.

I asked a friend what it was about. They say these are things that people donâ€™t need anymore so they leave it on the street. It's very common.

Throwing things away is not good for the environment. It is always better to use second-hand items. I like the way they think. So I accepted it.

Now I stop by next to the box Zu verschenken.

I furnished my apartment with second-hand items. And I enjoy it.
