title: 'Zu verschenken Boxes'
------
I recently moved to Berlin.

I walk down the street and notice boxes with a note - Zu verschenken (ger. To be gifted).

Passers-by often stand next to the box to see what is hidden in there.

You can usually find children's things - toys, car seats, clothes, baby equipment. Then books, adult clothes and furniture. From furniture, mostly shelves, refrigerators, mattresses, chairs, things that are easily portable.

I asked a friend what it was about and they said it was something people didn’t need so they wanted to share it with others so they wouldn’t throw things away.

Because throwing things away is not good for the environment. It is always better to use second-hand items. I like the way they think. So I accepted it.

Now I stop by next to the box Zu verschenken. I furnished my apartment with second-hand items. And I enjoy it.
