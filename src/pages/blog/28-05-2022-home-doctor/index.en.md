I recently moved to Berlin.
It was some January, while it still did not occur to us that there was a possibility that a visit to the office would be banned. Before the Corona.
One by one, colleagues started going on sick leave. It couldn't get around me.

I called HR to let them know that I would have to go to the hospital. The HR was surprised and asked if I needed help. I explained to her that I had flu symptoms.

I was told that I could go to the family doctor (Hausartzt).
And she explained that only patients with serious illnesses or emergencies go to the hospital.

We donâ€™t have a Family Doctor concept in our health system. They are general practitioners, chosen by patients. Patients generally choose doctors in their area of living. If the patient does not feel well, then it is possible to get an appointment that day. If the patient wants a checkup, then the appointment could be assigned within a couple of weeks.

For the seasonal flu, I was prescribed 10 days of sick leave and tea.
