I visit Serbia in April 2021. I only pack "summer Berlin things" - leggings, a blouse with long sleeves, a light spring jacket. I expect Serbia to greet me with warmer weather. I'm not in Berlin after all. Needless to say, I freeze.

<h2>Flight Scheduling</h2>

I’d heard various reports of flights being cancelled without notice, and I am afraid that the same will happen to me.

But I book a flight anyway. I’m on the Air Serbia website because I have a voucher for my flight that was cancelled last Easter. There are not many choices. Air Serbia no longer flies as often as it used to.

I go through the booking process and I’m looking for the place that I can type in the reference number from the voucher. But it’s not so easy. No no. I can't find any additional field.

I open the bookmarked email and open the voucher. Now for the first time I properly read what is written on the voucher. In small letters, they explain that I need to call a certain phone number. The voucher can only be used by phone.

But the number is free only from within Serbia. Luckily I have a friend there that will take the time to sit on the phone with them and explain everything.

<h2>Entering Serbia from Germany</h2>

<h3>PCR test</h3>

The test must be taken a maximum of 48 hours before arrival in Serbia. I schedule a test online through <a href="https://www.centogene.com/index.php?id=2705&L=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centogene</a>, a company that performs tests at Berlin airport and who now have another test station in Mitte. To enter Serbia, you just need a test. A test with your ID number attached is not necessary. At the moment it costs €79 . And I heard it cost € 69 in December.

It is not necessary to show a test at the border when you leave Germany.

But it is once you arrive in Serbia. And there I heard that some were allowed to enter Serbia without a PCR test and without quarantine, which is mandatory if no PCR test has been performed.

<h2>The Flight</h2>

The flight was actually on time and without any delay. We even arrived in Belgrade a little early.

It was interesting to me that after the flight attendants served snacks, chips, and water, everyone took off their masks and started eating and drinking. It never occurred to me to take off my mask. The PCR test is not 100% safe. But no one seems to care. Neither the airline nor the passengers. It's chips.

<h2>Entering Germany from Serbia</h2>

The test must be performed 48 hours before the flight. <a href="https://euprava.gov.rs/usluge/6221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The PCR test for entering Germany from Serbia is free</a> for Serbian citizens that reside in Germany. This makes staying in Serbia much easier. It is necessary to make an appointment on the eGovernment website.

Be careful when choosing the time.

If you accidentally make a mistake and want to change the time of the appointment in Belgrade for the same day but at another time, it is not possible: neither through the service, nor over the phone. I succeeded via email after a few days, and over the phone they recommended that I come in person.

The test is performed at <a href="https://www.zdravlje.org.rs/index.php/kontakt " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the City Institute for Public Health in Belgrade</a>.

It is possible to enter Germany without a test, if it is done in Germany within 48 hours of entry.

And you need to fill out <a href="https://www.einreiseanmeldung.de/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the online form to enter Germany</a>, which is checked in Serbia.

<h3>Info for Berlin</h3>

 You can leave quarantine after 5 days if your test is negative. <a href="https://www.berlin.de/corona/en/measures/#headline_1_20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berlin info</a>.

<h2>Masks and General Attitude Towards COVID in Serbia</h2>

If you are afraid of COVID and follow the rules from Germany, staying in Serbia will be a stressful experience.

You will have to talk about COVID many times.

There will be a lot of people on public transport who do not wear masks. People will sit next to you even though certain seats are blocked. Even though it is Sunday, there are less people on public transport, and there are plenty of other seats.

Do not visit the supermarket even in madness. Nobody wears masks there.

The general attitude is: “... if you get sick, then it is what is is. Many have died. "

And it's nice to be in the company of friends and family.
