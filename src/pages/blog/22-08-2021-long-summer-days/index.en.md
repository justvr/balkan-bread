I moved to Berlin this winter.

But then summer came. Not really by temperature, but by the length of the day.

The sun sets about an hour after it sets in Serbia. And it is still somehow visible even later. About half past ten at some point.

Yes, the north is in question. It is cold, but sometimes there are longer warm periods, up to a week, up to 30 degrees. And in the recent past even up to 35 degrees.

Such high temperatures have come with climate change and then it can be very uncomfortable in the apartments. Because air conditioners in homes and offices are a rarity.

It is not allowed to install air conditioners anywhere. And more buildings are made to keep the heat as Iâ€™ve heard. With temperatures of 25, it is already warm in the apartments.

But free time after work is long. You don't have to run to get things done and use the day, but you can slowly come back from work and enjoy a long day.
