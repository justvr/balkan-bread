title: 'Hug instead of a Kiss'
------
I recently moved to Berlin.

I returned to Serbia for the first time after a few months.

My friends were a little surprised when I greeted them. It wasnâ€™t obvious to me, but then they told me they were expecting at least one kiss.

I forgot a bit, because Germans greet each other with a hug.
