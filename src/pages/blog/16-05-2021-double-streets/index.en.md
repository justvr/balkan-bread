I meet a couple of interesting people and they invite me to a bar. I look up the address on the internet and head out.

I arrive at the address, but there’s no bar. Residential buildings only. I check the street and the number. Everything is correct.

I call them and they come outside the bar. But they don't see me, and I don’t see them. Finally they send me their location. They’re on the other side of town. What the hell?!

<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Streets_in_Berlin_having_the_same_name_as_another_street_in_Berlin" rel="noopener noreferer" target="_blank">There are a lot of streets with the same name in Berlin</a>, so make sure you share the postcode as well as the address.

If the bar is famous enough the postcode isn’t shared because...people just know.

But I’ve just moved to Berlin.
