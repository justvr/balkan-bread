I recently moved to Berlin.

And I met someone.

And he’d recently moved to Berlin too.

We became friends. He is German. And he’s led a different sort of life from mine. He’s traveled to various distant lands, with koalas, elephants, and other exotic creatures.

I listened to his stories about the culture, the people, and the nature he saw. And about how much our consumerism is destroying all of it. And how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-nature-is-sending-us-a-message-says-un-environment-chief" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the destruction over there affects our world here</a>. Which is best proved by the coronavirus crisis.

He talked about solutions, and how we can help fix all of this. He was talking about a web browser called <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/?c=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ecosia</a>.

Ecosia uses their earned advertising income to plant trees around the world. They don’t just plant trees, but they also educate citizens about sustainable development and involve the local population in their projects. So far they have planted over 110 million trees.

And that's not the end of their work. They follow the growth and development of trees and forests over the years. And the changes that those trees bring to the whole community.

It's as simple as us using a web browser and search engine just as we always have. And presto, trees get planted.

Another friend who tested it didn’t like that the browser had no inbuilt translation feature. Unfortunately, he stopped using Ecosia because of that.

I'm currently using Eco, and I don't really see a difference in usage compared to Google Chrome. More precisely, I enjoy using Ecosia.

I love reading the reports of how much this has meant to families around the world. I love it when they show how much good the browser has brought to ecosystems around the world. I love it when I look at the upper right corner of my screen and it says how many trees I’ve been responsible for planting (667 currently).

And if I may brag a little bit more - I indirectly planted a few hundred more trees when I persuaded a couple of family members to start using Ecosia.

And hopefully I’ll plant a few more when you try it out.
