title: 'Little Gold Plaques'
------

Whilst walking around the city I always see gold plaques embedded in the sidewalks.

I pay them no mind. I have my own worries. But my gaze constantly returns. These little gold plaques always stand out.

This time I pay attention. Each plaque contains a first name, a surname and 2 dates. Sometimes 1 plaque is by itself, sometimes there are a couple of plaques placed together on the ground.

Sometimes candles are lit next to the plaques. Right in the middle of the sidewalk. What is that?

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein" rel="noopener noreferer" target="_blank"><i> Stolperstein</i></a> are installed in memory of the victims of Nazi executions and persecution.

The plaques are located in front of the apartment buildings where the victims lived before the Nazis took them to their deaths. In a lot of places there are several plaques with the same surname. Whole families with the same year of death.

They try not to forget their crimes here in Germany.
