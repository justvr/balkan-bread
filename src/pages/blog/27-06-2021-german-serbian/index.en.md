------
I've been living in Berlin for some time.

Here I am surrounded by newcomers, like me, so the unofficial language is English.

However, from time to time the city reminds me that I live in Germany and that the official language is still German.

All the immigrants talk about how difficult German is, but then they also say that they learn it through series and movies. There are few who try to really learn. Mostly only when they have to. Either because of work or because of documentation.

They say the cases are difficult, and there are only four in German.

They say: well, they also have a middle gender.

Nouns are written in capital letters. Many words are written together. And then combined with articles.

So mostly people who live in Berlin for a couple of years say they speak B1 and attend A2.2 or B1.1. I am not an exception.

Speaking other languages ​​helps, because German shares many words with English, French and other Western European languages. But also with Serbian.

I always joke when I hear a Serbian word that German stole words from Serbian.

Because I really recognize a lot of them from the Serbian dictionary.

If I don't know a word in German, I try it in English, then in Serbian.

And sometimes I really guess.
