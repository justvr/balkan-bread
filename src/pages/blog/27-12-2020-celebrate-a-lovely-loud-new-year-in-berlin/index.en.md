------

Even before I moved to Berlin, I’d heard big things about how they celebrated New Years Eve. And I didn't really believe it until I saw it.

For a select few days in December, speciality stores open up for the sale of pyrotechnics to avid customers (and their young children).

For the special price of just € 149.99, these stores offer fireworks of gargantuan, unimaginable sizes.

There’s also a well-known path to the cheaper shops of Poland for firecrackers that shoot harder, louder, and more often than anything found in Germany.

The traditional German days off surrounding the New Year are the second half of December 31st, and the full day on January 1st. In Serbia they’re January 1st and 2nd.

After the sun goes down on December 31st the fireworks start in Berlin. New Year’s Eve begins somewhere around 6pm and it does not let up.

Those who have nothing planned for the evening can join the parties in the <i>ringbahn</i>, the train that circles central Berlin in a similar way to Tram 2 in Belgrade.

At midnight true bedlam begins, for which everyone has been preparing for days.

People go out on the street and light the pyrotechnics that they’ve collected during the previous month. It's a sound I’ve never experienced before.

Thick smoke stops any sparse traffic still on the streets.

And the next day, there is endless garbage covering the streets. Everything is covered with glasses, bottles, boxes, firecracker caps, fireworks, confetti…

In some streets, the remains of New Year's Eve stick around for 3+ weeks. I can assume the city can't keep up with it.

Passers-by, including me, join the voluntary actions of cleaning the parks. Plastic bags, brooms, rakes, gloves and other utensils are organized by kindly local souls.

This year, in 2020, they banned fireworks. I can't say I'm displeased about that.
