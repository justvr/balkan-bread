------

Even before I moved to Berlin, I’d heard big things about how they celebrated New Year’s Eve. And I didn't really believe it until I saw it.

For a select few days in December, speciality stores open up for the sale of pyrotechnics to avid customers (and their young children).

For the bargain price of just € 149.99, these stores offer fireworks of gargantuan, unimaginable sizes.

There’s also a well-trodden path to the cheaper shops of Poland for firecrackers that shoot harder, louder, and more often than anything found in Germany.

The traditional German days off surrounding the New Year are the second half of December 31st, and the full day on January 1st. In Serbia they’re January 1st and 2nd.

After the sun goes down on December 31st the fireworks start in Berlin. New Year’s Eve begins somewhere around 6pm and it does not let up.

Those who have nothing planned for the evening can join the parties in the <i>ringbahn</i>, the train that circles central Berlin in a similar way to Tram 2 in Belgrade.

At midnight true bedlam begins, for which everyone has been preparing for days.

People go out on the street and <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/column-germanys-inexplicable-love-affair-with-fireworks/a-55746329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">light the pyrotechnics</a> that they’ve collected during the previous month. It's a sound I’ve never experienced before.

Thick smoke stops any sparse traffic still on the streets. Teenagers use starter pistols to <a href="https://berlinspectator.com/2020/12/08/berlin-interior-senator-geisel-worried-about-new-years-eve-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fire blanks into the air</a> (or at random cars, pedestrians, each other etc etc). They look pretty similar to the real thing. You’ll find spent casings all over the streets for days afterwards.

And the next day, there is endless garbage covering the streets. Everything is covered with glasses, bottles, boxes, firecracker caps, fireworks, confetti…

In some streets, the remains of New Year's Eve stick around for 3+ weeks. I assume the city can't keep up with it.

Neighbours organise their own cleaning crews, complete with plastic bags, brooms, rakes, gloves and an impressive amount of enthusiasm for a New Year’s morning. Casual passers-by join in the voluntary cleaning actions.

This year, in 2020, <a href="https://polizei-berlin.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=93f72d461ce74214880e0fa49d8f4c40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they banned fireworks in certain parts of Berlin</a>. I can't say I disagree with the decision.
