------
There are a lot of emotions when you buy a one-way ticket. And when you don't know what awaits you. And when your mother wants you to stay but you’d rather not come back.

When there is no real reason to leave, but you feel like you’ve spent your whole life there. You feel like you don't belong there. And that you need to live something different in order to feel better.

You want to really test yourself. And get to know yourself. You want to leave the social and cultural ties you knew.

And then you're already at the airport. And your family is saying goodbye. And tears do not come. Just excitement. And it's time to keep quiet and wait. But you don't know what awaits you

The unknown, I suppose.

And of course the most talkative person on the plane sits next to you. A middle-aged man who moved with his family from Serbia 30 years ago was sitting next to me on the flight. A man who complains about the 2019 economic situation in Germany. That it is not the same as before. We’ve all heard it so many times. But why would it be the same as before ?!

He misses the old days when only he worked and his wife didn’t have to. He talks about how the money overwhelmed him. How they have two cars. He bought the second one because he wanted a better one than the first.

Everything comes full circle. He needs more money.

And then you land. You enter an unknown apartment, because you didn't have the money to get to Berlin early to look at apartments yourself. You’ve invested all your savings in a visa and relocation. And you borrowed more.

You go to work the following day. You start over.

And you find the <i>proja</i> (cornbread) your mother secretly packed. Then the tears start falling.
