Something’s missing from the parks. They’re full of people (Berliners love to spend their free time in the parks). There’s trash, cigarette butts… ahaaa but no empty bottles!

Well, yes. Of course! Bottle recycling is very simple and accessible to everyone.

And how does it work?

Supermarkets have special vending machines where you deposit empty bottles and cans and receive a printed voucher in return. Hand over the voucher at the checkout and you’ll receive money back on the spot. You get 25 cents for each plastic bottle or can, and 8 cents for a glass bottle.

But don’t be fooled. There’s a system to this. Not every bottle can be recycled. Only bottles with a special recycling mark are accepted. And not every supermarket accepts every bottle with a label. Rather they only accept brands that are sold in that supermarket.

But how are parks cleared of bottles? Not just parks but all public places.
If someone buys a bottle of juice in plastic packaging for 58 cents, and there’s an additional 25 cents deposit, that person will most likely be motivated to keep the bottle and get their money back, right?

And what about glass bottles? They are only 8 cents.

There are people for whom it is an additional source of income, or the only one ...  A person who scours the parks and city streets looking for bottles to pick up is known as a <i>pfandsammler</i>.
So those who are not bothered about keeping the bottle simply leave it next to any bin or by the side of a path. That bottle is usually picked up within a few minutes.

There was a <i>pfandsammler</i> that I had been seeing regularly at a train station for a year or so. One day he was ahead of me at the supermarket cashing a <i>pfand</i> voucher for 50 euros. That’s a lot of bottles.

Boom!
Bottle recycling cycle closed.
And it's a good pretzel with beer after work in the park.
