title: 'Berlin Apartment Hunting During a Pandemic'
------
Even before moving to Berlin <a href="https://youtu.be/838GDzXPVtA" rel="noopener noreferer" target="_blank">I’d already heard how hard it is to find an apartment</a>.

When I started applying for apartments the message I used was long and boring. Who am I, where I come from, who I’ve lived with in the past. I even tried making a joke...

After sending 50 applications and receiving only 2 responses, I called friends for help.

The application that finally got me to the next step, an apartment viewing, went like this:

Hi, I'm working as... and earning…. I don't smoke. I don't have a pet. I want to rent an apartment as soon as possible and I would like to take a look at yours. (in German and English)

I wasn’t that shocked the first time I saw 50 people waiting for an apartment viewing. Rows of stakeholders are inevitable. At least it makes it easy to find the right building.

I decided to use the time spent apartment hunting for something positive. I always greeted the crowd I’d see outside viewings.  We’d talk a little and exchange experiences. I’d even meet some again at other viewings. We checked out many of the same apartments. We dreamed of a time when we could all turn off the notifications on our apartment-hunting apps.

I didn't speak perfect German. Infact it’s more correct to say I didn’t speak German at all. I came up with one question to ask the estate agent:
<q>Where's the nearest supermarket?</q><q>Wo ist der nächste Supermarkt?</q>

I went to 26 apartment viewings before I eventually got offered one.

Most agencies did not even reply to my application. The rare times they did, the answer was a simple "No".

After 2.5 months of near constant apartment hunting I got used to being in a bad mood… At work, I found complete understanding whenever I asked to go out and look at an apartment during working hours.

I stopped playing sports, eating properly, meeting up with friends… I was really desperate. I had nightmares where I was forced to move out of Berlin because I couldn’t find a place to live.

Almost all of my friends who started looking for an apartment around the same time as me found one. I was happy for them but I kept asking myself: where am I going wrong?

"Everyone finds an apartment eventually" is a sentence I heard many times. Then finally I found an apartment too!

I learnt that finding a flat in Berlin is like a lottery.... You gotta keep playing if you want to win.
