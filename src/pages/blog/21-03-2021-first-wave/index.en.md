title: 'The First Wave'
------

It all started somewhere far away.

Silence. Traffic has stopped. Quarantine has started. Public transport is empty. Everyone who can work from home. Everyone is on a 24-hour shift.

Those who managed to keep their jobs accepted the ‘new normal’ of working from home.. I heard: “I can finally spend more time with the kids” , “I finally don’t have to waste time commuting to work” - “I can save money on lunch”.

Everyone started doing exercise at home. They start jumping around the house, running and skipping. There is talk of new recipes being learnt. Everyone is cleaning their house constantly. Unnecessary things are thrown out. The trash containers are full.

Many companies are turning to state aid. Germany is helping companies not to lose employees. Many friends switch to part-time work, the so-called <a href="https://nemackikutak.com/kako-nemacka-stiti-radna-mesta-u-vreme-krize-kurzarbeit/" rel="noreferer noopener" target="_blank"><i>Kurzarbeit</i></a>.

Quarantine started in Serbia 2 weeks after Germany. Everything was prepared. The main trade hall was turned into a hospital. Masks were procured from the east, because the EU couldn't help.

And then in Serbia, quarantine becomes house arrest. The curfew starts at 6pm on weekdays and is all day during the weekend. Even bakeries are closed (in other countries the equivalent closure would be a supermarket. In Serbia if the bakeries are closed you know something is wrong). You can’t leave the house to walk the dog or to practice sports.

In Belgrade most people work until 5. Although some workers were allowed to work from home, there were many who did not have this opportunity.

Summer is on the doorstep.

In Berlin, no one wants to sit at home anymore. Parents are tired of babysitting. And they wonder when the schools and kindergartens will open. Companies support them because workers who are parents cannot work at full strength in the same way that they did before.

My lower back started to hurt from sitting and working from home. And my eyesight became worse from the impossibility of walking away from the computer, because, in addition to my job, my social life also switched to being exclusively online.

Everyone is slowly relaxing and trying to spend as much time outside as possible. The weather is getting better.

Those who work part-time or who lost their jobs are outdoors. The help of the state is enough to live on comfortably. No worries. The parks are full. There’s still a sense of some kind of freedom.

Illegal parties are organized, because gathering a large number of people is still forbidden. The number of newly diagnosed cases of corona is decreasing. Schools, kindergartens, restaurants are opening.

And in Serbia, after such a long and strict quarantine, where there was a curfew for Easter from Thursday to Tuesday, the quarantine is finally terminated. And everything returned to normal as if nothing had ever happened. And somehow just before the election.

Clubs are open, a football match is held, masks are not worn in stores, carelessness returns.

Until the moment when the Government, immediately following the elections, announced  a new quarantine and published data showing the situation in Serbia as significantly worse than it was only a few days earlier. Then the last straw fell on people and they could no longer bear the confusion except to take to the streets and say <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53332225" rel="noreferer noopener" target="_blank">Not again</a>.

Summer allows you to breathe again and to enjoy a little bit of what was considered normal life before.
