I recently moved to Berlin.

It was some winter.

Maybe last one, I am not sure anymore.

But I know exactly when summer came.

Then I started noticing small red kiosks, which sell only strawberries.

At the subway stations, at the corner next to the market, on the steps of the pool.
Everyone is sitting in the park eating strawberries. Beer and strawberries, wine and strawberries. They go with everything.
Spilled strawberries in the public transportation, red dirty hands of the lady sitting next to me.
Neighbors are collecting strawberries on the terrace. Friends go together to collect organic strawberries in a nearby garden.
It's all about strawberries.

And they are very tasty.
These are all home-grown strawberries from around Berlin.
Sweet and full of taste, like from my grandmother's garden.

And suddenly they disappeared again. And the kiosks were closed until next year.
