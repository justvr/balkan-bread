I recently moved to Berlin.
I woke up in the morning craving for something delicious and fatty. I need some common pastry that could be found in Serbianâ€™s bakeries.

But where are the bakeries?

Bakeries are located in supermarkets or they are big bakeries, so they look like cafes.

I'm going inside. They have fresh bread. Different types of fresh bread. Cakes. But where is the breakfast? I need something greasy.

Only small expensive sandwiches can be found in bakeries. I would eat a minimum of two for breakfast. <a href="https://www.balkanbread.com/en/oda-jogurtu" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yogurt </a> does not exist.

There are some Turkish bakeries that have Ajran and there you can find something most similar to our burek. Which they call "borek".

Of course they took the term from us.
