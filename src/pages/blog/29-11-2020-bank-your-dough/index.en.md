I recently moved to Berlin.

In the midst of the madness of moving, my employer asked me for a bank account where they could pay me my eagerly awaited salary.

Um, yes of course, the Serbian account won’t work. I told myself “Take a deep breath, warm up your fingers. It's time for a little more research infront of the computer".

The plan is: Open an account in any bank as soon as possible. Traditional German banks are quite slow, they require an <i> <a href="https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anmeldung</i></a> (residence registration), and mostly expect you to speak German. No, no and no.

Another option: A Mobile Bank in English, where registration is quick and easy, and where they don't ask me for an <i> Anmeldung </i>. Yes!

Below I compare the mobile banks I currently use. All have the same minimum criteria:

Basic card maintenance is free,
Registration is simple via the app and there are very clear instructions,
Everything is in English. German is not required

<a href="https://n26.com/en-eu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">N26</a> - German bank
Restriction - You can withdraw cash from German ATMs up to 5 times per month without fees. In other eurozone countries you get unlimited free withdrawals.

Advantages - offers 2 free <i> Places </i> (<i> Space </i>), in addition to the Main <i> Places </i> where you can stash your cash and clearly keep an eye on your spending. For example, Salary, Rent, Savings etc. It is immediately clear at the beginning of the month how much money is left to spend

<a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-DE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Revolut</a> -
A British bank that’s moving to Lithuania due to Brexit.

Restriction - you can withdraw € 200 per month from the ATM free of charge. After that there’s a charge of 2% for withdrawals.

Advantages - I sent the Revolut card to my parents because the exchange rates are very good. They can withdraw cash from the ATM at any time without worrying about the cost of converting it from Euros.

The Revolut mobile app gives you the option to buy stocks, so those interested in investing have an easy start. However,

<a href="https://vivid.money/en-eu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> VividMoney</a> - Russian-backed
VividMoney is a new mobile bank on the German market.

Restriction - On the free account you can withdraw up to €200 per month without fees, if you withdraw at least €50 each time.

Advantages - To try and attract new users they offer a variety of benefits. You can get cashback in the form of ‘stock rewards’ when using their debit card. For example, when shopping at Lidl, Aldi, Netflix, or Playstation you earn 10% cashback.

People who’ve been here a bit longer would always mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirecard_scandal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Wirecard affair when 1.9 billion euros disappeared</a>. So they wouldn’t consider an online bank for their primary bank.

I don't know how it will work out with these companies, but myself and many people keep their savings in mobile bank accounts.

I can say that so far I have had no problems with any of them.
