title: 'Locking down the Trash'
------
I recently moved to Berlin.

After entering the apartment the landlords took me outside to show me Everything.  Hmmm? What exactly?

We came to a wire fence. They unlocked it, and it's containers of different colors.

They have recycling here.  Hence different colors of the containers.

But what about the lock?

The garbage collected is measured, so the tenants of the buildings don't want to pay more than they produce.

German accuracy.
