I recently moved to Berlin.

When I first came here, I found it strange how cashiers would greet customers in supermarkets. Over time I’ve become used to it.

It seems to me that they are really trying to make at least a bit of conversation with customers. Yes, just a little bit, because they have such little time. But you can tell that they work hard.

I always hear them. They say “Good morning” with real feeling. I never think, "They said something, but I didn't hear it." Maybe because they have a bit more time than the oppressed cashiers in Serbia. And probably because they’re obliged to greet the customers

They work hard. But no matter how crowded the shop is, they will always say “Good afternoon”, “Hello” (...) when you enter, and “goodbye”, <i>Tchus</i>, <i>Schönen Tag (noch)</i> when you leave.

There is a joke among immigrants here, that you’ll never have the last word in supermarkets. They will always end up saying goodbye.

As for the customers, I have never seen them look uncomfortable with the cashiers. No tutting at the checkout or rolling their eyes. Maybe they don’t make it obvious. Customers are much calmer and have all the time in the world.

Which is a strange concept considering shops aren’t open on Sundays.

OK supermarkets aren't open, but you can find small stores where the range of products is limited and more expensive. These famous shops are known as <i>Spätkaufs</i>, or <i>Spätis</i> for short, basically meaning ‘late shop’.

So 95% of purchases are made before Sunday. No one likes to waste money. Sunday is not counted as a day for shopping, but rather a day for family, friends and nature.

Hey, I'm going to buy bread. They are closing the shops soon.
