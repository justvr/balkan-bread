------
I'll get some information on where to look for an apartment, depending on which apartment you want to find.

<h2>Your own apartment</h2>

If you want to live alone, start with <a href="https://www.immobilienscout24.de/" rel="noopener noreferer" target="_blank">ImmoScout24</a>. I recommend to download the mobile application and set notifications with certain filters that suit you the best (price, part of the city, number of rooms, garage ..., pet - dog, cat and other larger animals “should be" reported).

<h2>Looking for a room</h2>

If you want to have or to share an apartment with someone try <a href="https://www.wg-gesucht.de/" rel="noopener noreferer" target="_blank"> WG Gesucht</a>.

<h2>Apartment exchange</h2>

If you already live in Berlin <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ebay.kleinanzeigen&hl=en&gl=US" rel="noopener noreferer" target="_blank">Ebay Kleinanzeigen</a> has the most flats that can be exchanged for other flats.

<h2>Where else</h2>

Follow Facebook groups. There are special groups for looking for apartments. I’ve heard some people got lucky there too.

<h2>Agencies</h2>

Agencies I dealt with while looking for an apartment in 2020:
<ul>
  <li>Stadthaus - an open invitation arrives via the newsletter to the email address. A lot of people show up visiting apartments. They offer old overpriced apartments in my opinion. I was about 10 times to look at the apartment with this agency, but they never made an offer to me. Even sometimes the agent doesn’t bother to show up at the viewing, and I heard from other interested parties that this is common for this agency;</li>
  <li>Gewobag - has nice apartments at a lower price, but also many <a href = "https://www.gewobag.de/fuer-mieter-und-mietinteressenten/service/informationen-und-ratgeber-fuer-mieter/wohnberechtigungsschein/" rel = "noopener noreferer" target = "_ blank">WBS flats</a> - social flats given to people with very low incomes which are subsidized by the state. If you come with a working visa, you cannot have that salary. So forget about these apartments with Serbian citizenship;</li>
  <li>ADO - this agency is one of my favorites. The whole process is online. They are sending an application, which must be confirmed. When it comes to viewings, the agent confirms that you were present at the viewing. And then… Well, I don't know. I didn't get further in the process. But the apartments I saw were nice, bright and most importantly cheap;</li>
  <li>Howoge - they sent me an email to tell me I had entered the Lottery to potentially look at the apartment;</li>
  <li>Szich Immobilien - I was at the viewing once. The apartment was awful, a little further away, but cheap. One of the 2 apartments I didn’t apply for. That’s how bad this apartment was;</li>
  <li>Akelius - slightly more expensive apartments, new, and in good locations;</li>
  <li>Deutschen Wohnen;</li>
  <li>Dreimalfrauen - they do not have many apartments and offer them at a higher prices;</li>
  <li>Höme - very well organized and with excellent communication. They note your presence at the viewing. And they sent me an email right the next day to tell me I got the apartment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deposit</h2>

A 3-rent deposit must be paid when the contract is signed. And the rent starts from 300-400 euros. Calculate for yourself.

And good luck.
