May 1st in Berlin

I recently moved to Berlin.

And here they celebrate May 1st. I look forward to a day off. I don’t ask for the reasons behind it.

I ask acquaintances: "Where are you going for May Day?" Everyone hesitates as they answer.

I make plans with those who have told me they have no plans. I think it’s a little weird that they don’t have plans for May Day. But ok, a new environment. I have to get used to it.

We meet at noon. We bring food and wireless speakers. It's going to be crazy.

We go to the park. There’s noone there. Just us. The park is empty. Not a single dog out for a walk either. I've never seen that before. Parks are always full of people. Rain or shine, people are there.

And then I hear… Everyone is at the <a href="https://youtu.be/pu4QYjsyy-U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> May Day party and demonstrations</a> on the other side of town.

Okay, maybe next year then.
