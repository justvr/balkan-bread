title: 'Knocking on a Table'
------
I recently moved to Berlin.

After the meeting I was overwhelmed by the thunderous colleagues' acceptance of decisions by banging fist on the table. The same as knocking on a door.

Colleagues started knocking together.

And the new German colleague, who started working the same day as me, completely fit in and he started doing the same.

The sound in the meeting room leaves an impressive serious impression that something significant has been completed.

As a sound signal to prepare. Tasks are delegated, it's time to work.

But letâ€™s grab a coffee first.
