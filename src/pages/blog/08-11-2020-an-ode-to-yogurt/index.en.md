------
There’s only one <i>real</i> yogurt! But not in Germany. Or any country in Western Europe from what I’ve seen.

In Serbia, yogurt is a liquid and is eaten with everything. You’ll find it in the refrigerator door in a tetrapack, in a bottle, or a glass...or maybe in all 3 at once.. It goes with everything: fried eggs, a cheese sandwich, tomato, even jam. Surely, I’m not the only one who eats jam and yogurt. People love worse things - for example Nutella or Eurocrem and yogurt! For those unfamiliar, Eurocrem is the Serbian version of Nutella. Some say it’s even better than the original (myself included).

Yogurt boasts numerous healing powers. It’s the best cure for a sore head the morning after a party. It can be taken after a careless sleep on the beach to soothe a painful sunburn. It neutralizes the smell of burek better than chewing gum. Plus those who can't digest milk can drink yogurt!

Then there’s the traditional summer salad: yogurt and cucumber cut into rings with a little salt. Traditional, because only my grandmother prepared it. And it’s really delicious and refreshing. Try it if you’re curious. I also add some oregano because I’m fancy like that. Mmm any time we smelt corn bread on weekend mornings, we knew that ajvar and yogurt were already on the table. We have thousands of stories like this in Serbia. Other people don’t understand.

In Germany, they call yogurt something similar to sour milk. After eating it, you’re left with the taste of old cheese. It’s kind of creamy and airy. It is eaten mostly for breakfast with berries. Mostly blueberries. Or they make cakes with "yogurt".

Over here they have many different dairy products that I have not tried before. The most similar Serbian-like product that I’ve found over here is something like sour cream.

The only place I found yogurt like ours was in Brittany, France. They proudly showed it off as a delicacy of their area.

They also talked to me about ways that we can reduce our consumption of dairy products.

Which is starting to make more and more sense.
