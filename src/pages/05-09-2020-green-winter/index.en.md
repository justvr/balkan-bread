I recently moved to Berlin.

I arrived one January afternoon. It was already getting dark at 3pm. In winter, darkness falls an hour earlier than in Serbia, which is compensated in summer when it falls an hour later.

When I went outside the next morning, I noticed that spring was here forever. Berlin is green even in winter! The vegetation is green. And no, I'm not talking about evergreen trees.
Deciduous trees have of course lost their leaves, but the bark of the trees is covered in green moss. I wouldn't say it has a thick layer of moss, but somehow it stays green.

And the grass is completely green. Perhaps I noticed this just because there are more parks.
I think this kind of flora means there are more birds. They sing all year round. It’s not just sparrows and pigeons you see on the streets, but also many other birds. They sing and converse and live ... Ducks, swans and herons can be seen in lakes and in the busiest parts of the city.

And people don’t feed the birds bread because they are aware of the negative effect on the flora of the lake. They feed them specially prepared bird food - seeds that are mixed with some ball-shaped mass that hangs in net bags from trees. They’re about the size of a fist and can even be found in supermarkets.

In Serbia I have seen this only in documentaries about national parks and sometimes from people who live near forests. They feed the birds in the same way to help them survive the winter.

Green year.
